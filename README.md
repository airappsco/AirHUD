## üîß Installation
AirHUD is distributed via **Swift Package Manager** üì¶. 

To install AirHUD, please add the following line to the `dependencies:` section in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/airappsco/AirHUD.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "1.0.0")),
```

## üöÄ Usage

Import module in the file which will be used in
```swift
import AirHUD
```

Call related `airHUD` function after a SwiftUI View that takes up the whole screen with a bindable boolean and necessary information.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State var isPresented: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Spacer()
            Button("Show HUD") {
                isPresented = true
            }
            Spacer()
        }
        .airHud(isPresented: $isPresented,
                iconImage: Image(systemName: "doc.on.doc"),
                iconColor: Color(uiColor: .systemBlue),
                title: "Text Copied")
    }
}
```

There are 4 different `airHUD` functions. 3 of them provides ease of use for 3 different layouts with default UI customization. Last one provides customization over HUD elements such as fonts, colors, alignments and more.

        let iconConfiguration = IconConfiguration(image: .init(systemName: "star"),
                                                  color: .white,
                                                  position: .trailing,
                                                  size: Constant.customIconSize)
        let titleConfiguration = TitleConfiguration(text: "Added to Favorites",
                                                    color: .purple,
                                                    font: .headline.italic())
        let subtitleConfiguration = SubtitleConfiguration(text: "You can change your favorites at any time from favorites section",
                                                          color: .blue,
                                                          font: .callout)
        let dismissConfiguration = DismissConfiguration(autoDismiss: true)
        let generalConfiguration = GeneralConfiguration(backgroundColor: .orange,
                                                        horizontalAlingment: .center,
                                                        verticalAlignment: .bottom)
        let mode: AirHUDMode = .iconTitleAndSubtitle(icon: iconConfiguration,
                                                     title: titleConfiguration,
                                                     subtitle: subtitleConfiguration,
                                                     dismiss: dismissConfiguration,
                                                     general: generalConfiguration)
        return AirHUDConfiguration(mode: mode)
    }
```
```swift
        .airHud(isPresented: $isPresented,
                configuration: hudConfiguration)
```

### üèóÔ∏è Using AirHUD with UIKit

AirHUD also supports UIKit using a wrapper, though the underlying views utilize SwiftUI. You can achieve the same 4 configurations as presented above. However, due to the dependency on SwiftUI, the setup process slightly differs.

> **Note:** To use AirHUD with UIKit, you will need to switch to the `feature/ios-12-support` branch.

The steps to use AirHUD with UIKit are as follows:

1. **Import the AirHUD module.** Initiate AirHUDUIKitProvider in the file where it's needed.

```swift
import AirHUD
private let hudProvider = AirHUDUIKitProvider()
```

2. **Set up the type of HUD that suits your requirement.** 

For this, you need to provide an ID of type `String` and the target `UIViewController` where the HUD should be displayed. 

```swift
override public func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    setupIconAndTitleHUD()
}
```

Here is an example setup of an `IconAndTitle` HUD:

```swift
@objc func setupIconAndTitleHUD() {
    hudProvider.setupAirHUD(
        hudID: "1",
        hudType: .iconAndTitle(
            Image(systemName: "doc.on.doc"),
            .blue,
            "Text Copied"
        ),
        in: self
    )
}
```

3. **Present the HUD.** 

This can be executed from your trigger function by providing the HUD's ID:

```swift
@objc func didTapButtonStateIconAndTitle() {
    hudProvider.toggleAirHUD(hudID: "1")
}
```

You can check out the **[Example project](Example)** in the workspace for both SwiftUI and UIKit's detailed usage.
